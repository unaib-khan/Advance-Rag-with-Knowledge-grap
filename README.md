Hereâ€™s a README file tailored for your Knowledge Graph RAG System project:

Knowledge Graph RAG System
A Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed for academic research and enterprise knowledge management. This application combines advanced generative AI capabilities with the power of knowledge graphs to provide contextual and interactive query answering.

Features
Document Processing: Upload documents to parse and extract relevant knowledge.
Knowledge Graph Construction: Build and visualize knowledge graphs from the extracted data using Neo4j.
Interactive Query System: Ask natural language queries and receive contextual answers powered by LangChain and Groq LLM.
Graph Visualization: View relationships and insights through an intuitive graph visualization interface.
Scalable Architecture: Built for handling academic research papers, enterprise documents, and other textual data sources.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit for a user-friendly and interactive UI.
Backend:
Neo4j: For knowledge graph storage and querying.
LangChain: For advanced natural language query processing.
Groq LLM: As the language model backbone.
Visualization: Graph visualizations powered by Neo4j Browser.
Deployment: Compatible with local and cloud setups.
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/unaib-tech/Advance-Rag-with-Knowledge-grap
cd Advance-Rag-with-Knowledge-grap
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Neo4j:

Install and run Neo4j on your system.
Create a database and obtain the credentials (username, password).
Update the connection details in config.py or .env.
Launch the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Upload Documents: Drag and drop your documents into the app.
Build Knowledge Graph: Automatically extract entities, relationships, and visualize the knowledge graph.
Query the System: Use natural language queries to extract insights or retrieve specific information.
Visualize Results: Explore the relationships between entities through the interactive graph interface.
Applications
Academic Research: Organize and query research papers for literature reviews or knowledge extraction.
Enterprise Knowledge Management: Centralize and query organizational knowledge, enabling efficient decision-making.
Custom Use Cases: Adaptable for various domains requiring structured information extraction and retrieval.
Roadmap
 Integrate additional document formats (e.g., spreadsheets, presentations).
 Implement multi-language support for broader accessibility.
 Add custom visualization themes and export options.
 Extend compatibility with other LLMs and databases.
